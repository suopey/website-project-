	<h1>Portfolio</h1>

	<p>These are the projects I created in the DIG2000 class. I learned so many things on how to create Photoshop images, Premiere Pro videos, and a website with HTML.</p>
<div class="section">
	<h5>These are my Photoshop images I had created with layers!</h5>
	<h5>I had created these images using many different techniques I had learned in photoshop. I used layers, brushes, layer effects, adjustment layers, texts, smart object layers and shape layers! I really enjoyed taking the time to create both of these creative works as I got to put my knowledge into a big proejct that I could lead myself independently on.</h5>

	<h5>This is my Stop Motion video I created with 172 photographs.</h5>
	<h5>To create my Stop Motion video I had used two small figures on my desk. I had used my Dan Heng figure and my Cinnamoroll figure. I had used my canon T2i camera to take all of these images as well. Once I had taken all 172 photographs, I had exported all of them into Photoshop to create a stop motion video!</h5>

	<h5>This is my Short Film called "The Idea of Procrasination" I had created in Premiere Pro.</h5>
	<h5>This Short Film I had created took me a while to think about. I actually came up with the theme of procrasination while I was procrasinating on the project! The ideas came flowing to me once I decided to make the Short Film about all the tasks I had to tackle that day. I shot all the clips of this Short Film on my iPhone 15. I had then exported all of the videos through Airdrop onto my macbook and put them all in Premiere Pro to create this Short Film! </h5>
